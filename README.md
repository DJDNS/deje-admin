deje-admin
==========

A web-based DEJE admin server, allowing you to interact with the contents of a DEJE document at a low level.

### Current Status

Just placeholder stuff, plus a skeletal amount of go-deje integration. Right now, you can run deje-admin and see what the final interface will look like. Which is cool, but not as cool as seeing things actually working.

Hopefully this will be helpful for visualizing the way that DEJE documents can be managed at a low level. I know it's helped me so far in terms of API design.
